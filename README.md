## SamFirm-continued Development End

```
SamFirm-continued officially ended its development.
This is a decision that I made because I couldn't continue to develop for my own personal reasons.

# SamFirm-continued

> This is a SamFirm extension support project.

SamFirm is a program that lets you download stock firmware for your Samsung smartphone. It was first posted to the [XDA Forum](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-tab-s/general/tool-samfirm-samsung-firmware-t2988647), and it was very helpful to many people, including me.

However, the update has been down since 2016, .NET Framework 4 or later is not supported and non-up-to-date firmwares can't download anymore. So I used [updato.com](https://updato.com/) instead. This is an archive of firmware for each model, which allows users to download firmware that has been released so far without a subscription or speed limit, but the latest firmware is not apply quickly.

Therefore, using the source code posted on [GitHub](https://github.com/eladkarako/SamFirm-Source), I decided to change the ".NET Framework" to the latest version, delete the inoperable or unnecessary features, and make the existing difficult usage as easy as possible.

I hope this project will be useful to many users. ðŸ˜Ž
